The file you shared, `buildOutputCleanup.lock`, is a binary lock file used internally by Gradle to manage build output cleanup. You should not modify or delete this file manually unless you are troubleshooting Gradle build issues.

If you are experiencing a Gradle error related to this file, try the following steps:

1. **Close all Gradle processes.**
2. **Delete the `.gradle` directory** in your project root (this will remove all Gradle caches and lock files):
    ```
    rm -rf .gradle
    ```
    On Windows, you can delete the folder manually in File Explorer.

3. **Re-run your Gradle build**:
    ```
    gradle build
    ```

If you still encounter errors, please provide the exact error message for further assistance.
